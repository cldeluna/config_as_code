# Configuration As Code
***Companion Repository to [Kill the CLI](https://gratuitous-arp.net/kill-the-cli/) - Example of Configuration Templates***

There is nothing new about configuration templates. One way or another we all have them.   

They may live on the last device we configured, in a Notepad file (groan), in Excel (not sure which is worse), 
in a Word document (OK this is worse..at least Notepad is text), or in a code repository similar to what I am showing here.

This GitHub repository is the companion repository to the [Kill the CLI](https://gratuitous-arp.net/kill-the-cli/) post on The Gratuitous Arp.  It is intended to showcase an example of what can be done with "configuation as code" to get you one step closer to infrastructure as code.

This example represents a small step towards getting your configuration templates ready for Automation.  Even if you are not interested in Network Automation (in which case Im afraid you've stumbled into the wrong neighborhood), using a revision control system to track the changes to your templates overtime is in and of itself powerful and saves you some heavy lifting. 

Who changed the port channel mode  to LACP? to LACP active? When was that change made?  Who has the latest template?  All questions easily answered when your configuration templates are under revision control and in a revision control system.  GitHub and GitLab are some of the more recognizable and odds are a revision control system is already deployed in your Enterprise.

This repository takes a very basic configuration activity, configuring vPCs on Cisco Nexus switches,  and shows you the template under revision control AND with logic to easily generate configuations for one or more vPCs with varying numbers of interfaces in the port-channel.  In addition, it leverages a YAML file to store the "design" or "configuration details" needed to generate this configuration.  Further, it attempts to take away some of the personal variation you can see with this type of configuration.  

In the Python script which generates the configlet you can see the implementation of the guidelines in a consistent and reproducable manner.

Once you have this, its a simple matter to save the actual commands in a format which can then be pushed to the device.  More is needed to do that step with confidence but this is a start.  At least this is how I got started.  Production versions of this have more error checking PRE and POST.   The update and rollback commands are saved to JSON files which can then be loaded into a framework to push the commands.  But this little text file still comes in very handy for change control  as it has most of the information needed for change control.

If you are considering putting your templates in a revision control system I hope this helps get you started!
